				<p>Over 100 students, called &ldquo;midshipmen,&rdquo; at the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary&rsquo;s College train and prepare for future careers as Navy and Marine Corps officers. Our midshipmen have additional required commitments but are able to strike a balance between military discipline and life as a normal college student. To prepare our midshipmen, we focus on academics, leadership, physical fitness, and community involvement. Academic excellence is paramount to the success of each midshipmen and our students are held to a higher standard.  Additionally, midshipmen are taught key leadership traits and are given the opportunity to lead their peers. Each year, NROTC Notre Dame hosts a weekend conference in the spring called Naval Leadership Weekend where NROTC units from across the country join us to participate. Our midshipmen also participate regularly in physical fitness to maintain healthy lifestyles and lead more effectively. Lastly, we encourage community involvement through Trident Naval Society, our battalion led community service organization.</p>
